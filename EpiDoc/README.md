## EpiDoc training exercice 2016-05-24

### Assignment


1. team up
2. choose one inscription documented during the field explorations
3. find the EpiDoc corresponding file(s) (XML folder)
4. Open it in oxyGen and start to:
4.1 check the data
4.2 correct the data if necessary
4.3 enhance the data with the information you collected, expressing it and formating it so that it meets the needs of your research question.
4.4 do whatever seems interesting in your opinion...

####hints :
- if your oXygen is configured with the USEP framework, turn it off (ask Scott!)
- Ext.: means "extension"
- Ind.: means "indices"
- the research question must be concise (and doable with existing data) and precise, expressed in one line sentence
- choose some photographs you took: where and how will you add them in the epidoc file?
- think carefully about the <provenance> element using the EpiDoc Guidelines
- if you want to do an automatic timeline from this EpiDoc file, how will you format the dates?
